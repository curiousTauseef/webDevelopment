        <!--wro.xml declares a single "group" of resources called "angular-bootstrap", and this
        ends up being the base name of the static resources that are generated. It includes
        references to <css> and <js> elements in the webjars we added, and also to a local source
        file main.less.-->

        <!--wro.properties is a configuration file for the preprocessing and rendering engine in wro4j.
        You can use it to switch on and off various parts of the toolchain. In this case we use it to
        compile CSS from Less and to minify JavaScript, ultimately combining the sources from all the
        libraries we need in two files.-->

        <!--main.less could be used to customise the look and feel,
        changing the default settings in Twitter Bootstrap. E.g. to change the colours from default
        blue to light pink you could add a single line: @brand-primary: #de8579;-->
