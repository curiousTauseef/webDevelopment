    <!-- The "ng-cloak" class is applied to the content <div> so that dynamic content is hidden

    initial page load).-->

        <!--The content in the greeting is marked up using handlebars, e.g. {{greeting.content}}
         and this will be filled in later by Angular (using a "controller" called "home" according
          to the ng-controller directive on the surrounding <div>).-->

 the application behaviour.-->
