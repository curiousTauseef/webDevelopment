google doc: [Generating Client Libraries](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/endpoints/gen_clients)

##Generating a client library for Android using Maven

1. Invoke the following command in the directory containing your project pom.xml file:

```
mvn appengine:endpoints_get_client_lib
```

2. Locate the generated client library source directory and files, which are inside your project root directory at this subdirectory location: 
    - **`/target/endpoints-client-libs/<yourProjectName>`** and change directory to this location.

3. Invoke Maven to build the client library:

```
mvn install
```

4. This builds the required class files and creates the JAR file you need to add to your client project. The JAR file is located inside your current directory at this subdirectory location:

```
/target/<yourProjectVersion>.<versionString>-rc-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

5. Add the client library JAR to the Android app as described in Using Endpoints in an Android Client.

> Important: if you modify the API backend, you must repeat the above steps in order to update the client.



##To create the HelloEndpoints backend API:

- In a terminal window, change to the directory where you want to build the project.

```shell
mvn archetype:generate -Dappengine-version=1.9.30 -Dfilter=com.google.appengine.archetypes:
```

- Enter the number 4 to select the remote -> com.google.appengine.archetypes:hello-endpoints-archetype from the list of App Engine archetypes.
- Select the most recent version from the displayed list of available archetype versions by accepting the default.
- Define value for property 'groupId' = package name: com.junjunguo.endpoints
- Define value for property 'artifactId'	= artifact name : helloworld
- Accept the defaults for the remaining prompts.

**Design patterns**:

- Firebase
	- provides automatic data synchronization and authentication services	
- Firebase & App Engine
	- If your app needs to process user data or orchestrate events, extending Firebase with App Engine gives you the benefit of automatic real-time data synchronization.	
- Firebase & Managed VMs
	- The difference is that App Engine Managed VMs runs your backend service inside Docker containers that you can configure. This means you can call native binaries, write to the file system, and make other system calls.	
- **App Engine & Endpoints**
	- ![app engine could endpoints](files/roadmap-appengine-endpoints.png)
	- Google Cloud Endpoints generates APIs, client libraries, and discovery documentation for an App Engine application. Using Cloud Endpoints means you donâ€™t have to write wrappers to handle communication with App Engine. With the client libraries generated by Cloud Endpoints, you can simply make direct API calls from your mobile app.	
	- ![mobile endpoints app engine](files/endpoints.png)
- Compute Engine & REST/gRPC
	- Compute Engine lets you create and run virtual machines on Google infrastructure. You have administrator rights to the server and full control over its configuration. This also means that you are responsible for updates and maintenance.
