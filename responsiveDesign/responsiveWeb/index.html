        <p>Responsive web design (RWD) is an approach to web design aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal
           viewing experience—easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling—across a
           wide range of devices (from desktop computer monitors to mobile phones)</p>

        <p>A site designed with RWD[1][4] adapts the layout to the viewing environment by using fluid, proportion-based
           grids,[5][6] flexible images,[7][8][9] and CSS3 media queries,[3][10][11] an extension of the @media rule, in
           the following ways:</p>

        <p>The fluid grid concept calls for page element sizing to be in relative units like percentages, rather than
           absolute units like pixels or points</p>

        <p>Flexible images are also sized in relative units, so as to prevent them from displaying outside their
           containing element</p>

        <p>Media queries allow the page to use different CSS style rules based on characteristics of the device the site
           is being displayed on, most commonly the width of the browser.</p>
